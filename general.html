            <p>Climate change is characterized by gradual but detrimental changes in local, regional, and global weather patterns over an extended period of time, estimated to have started taking effect in the mid-1800's, climate change has only become a major issue in recent decades when our CO2 emissions increased dramatically due to industrialization.</p>

            <h1>How does global warming occur?</h1>
            <p>In environmental science, global warming is a trend of intense heatwaves, droughts, and increased temperatures throughout Earth, due to the trapping of CO2 in our atmosphere. Many people don't understand how this works, but it's simple to understand. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is classified as a greenhouse gas, these gases absorb infrared radiation or heat emitted from Earth's core throught the surface, trapping it inside the atmosphere. This prevents it from depositing into space and maintain equillibrium in the atmosphere. This in turn, raises Earth's temperatures. </p>
