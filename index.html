                <p class = "aboutsub">Since the start of the industrial revolution, we've made staggering advances in technology. But it has all come at a hefty cost: the crucial health of our planet. Due to overconsumption of non-renewable resources and mass industrialization, our planet's atmosphere is warming at an alarming rate. According to NASA's Climate Change page, "Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earthâ€™s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age."</p>
