                <p class = "aboutsub">Since the start of the industrial revolution, we've made staggering advances in technology. But it has all come at a hefty cost: the crucial health of our planet. Due to overconsumption of non-renewable resources and mass industrialization, our planet's atmosphere is warming at an alarming rate. According to NASA's Climate Change page, "Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earthâ€™s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age. The Industrial Revolution marked a turning point, as human activities began to introduce unprecedented levels of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Key milestones include the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988, which highlighted the urgent need for global cooperation, and the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, aiming to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. However, despite these efforts, global temperatures continue to rise, leading to extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and biodiversity loss. </p>
